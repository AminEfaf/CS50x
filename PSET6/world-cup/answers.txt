 Questions: Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I think N=100000 and N=1000000 results were incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after N=1000 there is no need for testing higher Ns.
